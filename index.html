      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/Victor Chung.jpg" class="my-picture" alt="picture of Victor Chung">

      <p>My name is Victor Chung. I live in Seattle, Washington. I am a student at the UW Boot camp. I am striving to be a 
        top-notch Web Developer in the very near future. This is a completely new game to me but I am up to the challenge.

      </p>Here is my educational backgroud in chronological order.
      
        <ul>
            <li>High School diploma from Sweet Home High School in Sweet Home, Oregon.</li>
            <li>2 year transfer program at Central Oregon Community College.</li>
            <li>B.S. Chemistry from the University of Oregon.</li>
            <li>Associate of Arts Technology in Computer Networking from Edmonds Community College.</li>
            <li>UW Coding Boot camp-ongoing.</li>

        </ul>
        
      <p>I have a diverse work experience. Upon receiving my degree in Chemistry, I went to work for a testing labratory in Portland, Oregon. 
        I did analytical work in organic and inorganic chemistry dealing with petroleum and environmental cleanup. My second chemistry job 
        was in Kelso, Washington where I only did environmental chemistry. My third and the last chemistry job was in Seattle, Washington and 
        that was also in environmental chemistry. I did analytical work in my first year at this company and ended up managing a small group of
        chemists, technicians, and a book-keeper for 4 years until it's closure, which was due to a downturn in the industry. Currently, I am 
        managing my own rental properties in the Puget Sound area.
      </p>

      </p>My hobbies are classic cars restoration and performing Chinese lion dances. I had restored a few cars in the last few years. Some of the cars I had restored 
        were a 1967 MGB, a 1969 BMW 2002, a 1974 BMW 2002, and a 1974 Mazda Rotary engine pickup. Currently, I have 2 classic VW bus which
        I intend to restore during my retirement years. 

        <p>For sports, I practice martial arts for health and self-defense. I had taught several classes in the past in the Portland and 
          Seattle area. Lion dances are part of my martial arts curriculum. I had performed as a group in many events such as Chinese New 
          Year, cultural celebrations in local schools, and in many events associated with the community which included fund-raising and 
          charities.
