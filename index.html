      <p>My name is Victor Chung. I live in Seattle, Washington. I am a student at the UW Coding Boot camp. I am striving to be a 
        top-notch Web Developer in the very near future. This is a completely new game to me but I am up to the challenge.

      </p>Here is my educational backgroud in chronological order.
      
        <ul>
            <li>High School diploma from Sweet Home High School in Sweet Home, Oregon.</li>
            <li>2 year transfer program at Central Oregon Community College.</li>
            <li>B.S. Chemistry from the University of Oregon.</li>
            <li>Associate of Arts Technology in Computer Networking from Edmonds Community College.</li>
            <li>UW Coding Boot camp-ongoing.</li>

        </ul>
        
      <p><p>I have a diverse work experience. Upon receiving my degree in Chemistry, I went to work for a testing laboratory in    Portland, Oregon. 

        I did analytical work in organic and inorganic chemistry dealing with petroleum testing and environmental cleanup. My second chemistry job was in Kelso, Washington, where I only did environmental chemistry. My third and the last chemistry job was in Seattle, Washington, and that was also in environmental chemistry. I did analytical work in my first year at this company and ended up managing a small group of chemists, technicians, and a book-keeper for 4 years until it's closure, which was due to a downturn in the industry. 

      </p>

      <p>After chemistry, I went back to school to study computer networking. I worked for about 5 years in this field. The work 

        I did in this field were: setting LAN and WAN network, internal telephone management(PBX),PC and Application support, 

        building pc from scratch, servicing printers and copiers, and low level network management.</p>



        <p>Eighteen years ago, I decided to be an entrepreneur. I started a profitable small company selling vehicle and marine 

          batteries plus repairing vehicle starting and charging system. In January of this year, I closed the business and 

          decided to try something new-Web Development. So, I enrolled in the UW coding boot camp. </p>

             

       <p> I have also been in the real estate investment for 16 years. Currently, I am managing my own rental properties in the    Puget Sound area. That entails seeking tenants, managing the day to day operation, fixing broken things, renovating       the units to comform to city codes, and the accounting. 
      </p>

        <p>My hobbies are classic cars restoration and performing Chinese lion dances. I had restored a few cars in the last few    years. Some of the cars I had restored were a 1967 MGB, a 1969 BMW 2002, a 1974 BMW 2002, and a 1974 Mazda Rotary        engine pickup. Currently, I have 2 classic VW bus which I intend to restore during my retirement years. 
        </p>

        <p>For sports, I practice martial arts for health and self-defense. I had taught several classes in the past in the         Portland and Seattle area. Lion dances are part of my martial arts curriculum. I had performed as a group in many        events such as Chinese New Year, cultural celebrations in local schools, and in many events associated with the          community which included fund-raising and charities. </p>
